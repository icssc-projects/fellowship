# ICSSC Projects Fellowship Syllabus
Welcome to the **ICS Student Council Fellowship**!

The goal of this course is to teach you fundamental software development and web development skills that arenâ€™t normally taught in the classroom. By the end of the quarter, you will have the skillset necessary to create your own React websites and will have the opportunity to contribute to one our ICSSC Projects such as [AntAlmanac](https://antalmanac.com), [PeterPortal](http://peterportal.org), or [Zotistics](http://zotistics.com)!

This is an **asynchronous** course with prerecorded videos, weekly assignments, and virtual Discord Office Hours. You should be able to commit 2-3 hours per week for this Fellowship.

## <u>Course Content</u>

Every Monday, the unit for the week will be available on this website. Each unit will contain a pre-recorded video, external resources, and your assignment(s) for the week. You can look through this material at your own pace at a time that is convenient for your schedule. 

We recommend reviewing the material as soon as possible though, so you can ask questions in Discord and/or Office Hours during the week.

### Assignments

Assignments are **due Monday at 11:59pm.** unless stated otherwise. 

Each assignment will have a list of required tasks and a list of optional stretch goals for you to complete. You will receive a point for each task that you complete.

### Passing the Course

In order to pass the course, **you must complete all of the required tasks on all of the assignments**. 

### Points Scoreboard

Every point that you earn during the course will be added to your overall score. At the end of the quarter, the top performing students will receive a small prize (TBA ðŸ˜‰)

### Late Policy

For each day that an assignment is late, you will lose 25% of the points on that assignment.

> *Example:* if you turn in an assignment 1 day late that had 4 tasks, you will lose 25% (1 point) and only receive 3 points.

Since every unit builds on top of the previous one, it is important that you complete each assignment on-time.
