# Unit 6: Scripting with JavaScript

## Welcome to Unit 6

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language, also considered the programming language of the web.
Many web developers use JavaScript to create websites and add behavior to them.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level language and is very similar to many languages you might have used before (Python, Java).
Here's a quick overview of the basics.

### Printing

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); 
// In Web Development, this will actually show up in the developer console. 
// Open the console in Chrome with cmd+alt+j (mac) or ctrl+shift+j (windows)
```

### Variables

Variables are dynamically-typed, meaning, they don't have a type (like in Python).
Undefined variables have the value `undefined`.
We use the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to define variables.

| Keyword | Behavior | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| var | Defines a variable limited in scope to the function. | Don't use var. To learn more, read ["Why don't we use var anymore?"](https://medium.com/@codingsam/awesome-javascript-no-more-var-working-title-999428999994). |
| let | Defines a variable limited in scope to the block. | Use when you need to change the value of the variable later on. |
| const | Defines a variable limited in scope to the block, but its value is constant. | You should always use const unless you need to change the value of the variable later on. |


```javascript
let x = 'hello';
x = 1234;			// the `x` variable can be changed.
const pi = 3.14; 	// the `pi` variable cannot be changed.
```


### Strings
Strings are a collection of characters.
They can be enclosed in either single quotes `' '` or double quotes `" "`.

There are a lot of powerful [built-in string functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt) for you to use.
Here are a few popular examples:
```javascript
const clubName = 'icssc';
console.log(className); 				// icssc
console.log(className.length); 			// 5
console.log(className.toUpperCase());	// ICSSC
console.log(className.indexOf('ss')); 	// 2
console.log(className.includes('cs'));	// true
console.log(className.startsWith('i'));	// true
console.log(className.endsWith('sc'));	// true
```

You can also perform string interpolation using backticks `` ` ` ``.
String interpolation is when you inject an expression into a string.
In JavaScript, this is called "template literals".
You can put any expression into the string using a dollar sign and curly brace: `${expression}`.

```javascript
let likes = 5;
console.log('This post has ' + likes + ' likes');	// "This post has 5 likes"
console.log(`This post has ${likes} likes`);		// "This post has 5 likes" <- same but cleaner

// You can also compute expressions inside the string
console.log(`I wish I had ${likes * 10} likes!`)	// "I wish I had 50 likes!"
```

### Arrays

Arrays are almost exactly the same as they are in Python.

```javascript
const array = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3];
console.log( array[2] ); // "c"
console.log( array.length );// 6
//add item to end of the array
array.push('4');

//combine elements into a string
const str = array.join('-');
console.log(str); //=> "a-b-c-1-2-3-4"

//get index of an element (first occurrence)
const oIndex = array.indexOf('x'); //=> 3
```

JavaScript arrays also have methods that help us create and modify arrays.
These are the map, filter and reduce functions.
These will iterate over an array and perform a transformation or computation.
Then they will return a new array based on the result of the function.

#### Map
The `map()` function creates a new array from an existing one. 
It applies a function to each one of the elements of the first array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(function(item) {
	return item * 2;
});
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

#### Filter
The `filter()` function applies a conditional to each element in the array.
If the conditional is true, the element is pushed in the output array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(function(item) {
	return item % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evens); // [2, 4]
```

#### Reduce
The `reduce()` function rerduces the values of an array to just one value.
It does so by accumulating a value as it iterates through the array.
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//result is the accumulator - the returned value of the previous iteration
//item is the current item in the array.
const sum = numbers.reduce(function (result, item) {
  return result + item;
}, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
```

### Loops and Conditionals

JavaScript uses curly brackets `{}`, to denote code blocks for ifs, and loops. 

```javascript
if (i > 5) {
	console.log('i is bigger than 5');
} else if (i >= 3) {
	console.log('i is between 3 and 5');
} else {
	console.log('i is less than 3');
}
for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
	console.log(x);
}
while (true) {
	console.log("repeat");
}
```

We can also use for-each loops in javascript, but only for arrays. 
This is similar to the map, filter and reduce function mentioned in the previous section. 
This uses a callback function, more on this [later](#callback-functions).
```javascript
const array = ["one", "two", "three"]
array.forEach(function (item, index) { // notice how a function is passed into forEach function call.
  console.log(item, index);
});
```

In fact, JavaScript also has something cool called a for-of loop. 
This lets us loop through iterables like strings and arrays.
```javascript
const str = "fellowship"
for (const element of str) {
  console.log(element);
}
```

### Objects

Similar to Python Dictionaries, these are an unordered set of key-value pairs. 
Unlike python, you don't need quotes around the keys. 

```javascript
const ages = {alice:40, bob:35, charles:13}
const things = {num:12, dog:'woof', list:[1,2,3]}

//both of these work!
console.log(ages["alice"]); // 40
console.log(ages.bob); // 35
```

### Functions
Define the `sayHello` function that takes in two parameters, `firstName`, and `lastName`.  
In JavaScript, parameters are optional. 

```javascript
function sayHello(firstName, lastName) {
	return "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName;
}

console.log(sayHello("Raman", "Gupta")); // Hello, Raman Gupta
console.log(sayHello()); // Hello, undefined undefined
```

#### Arrow Functions
Arrow functions are a newer feature of JavaScript, and let us write functions with much shorter syntax. 
```javascript
const otherSayHello = (firstName, lastName) => {
	return "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName;
};
```
Arrow functions return a value by default, so if it only requires one statement to write the function, we can cut it even shorter. 

```javascript
const otherSayHello = (firstName, lastName) => "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName;
```


### Callback Functions

Functions are objects, and can be passed as arguments to other function calls. 

```javascript
//Iterate through an array
let array = ['a','b','c'];
let printItem = function(item) {
 console.log(item);
}
array.forEach(printItem);
```
We can use anonymous functions to reduce how much code we write even more. 
This way we don't have to give each function a name.
```javascript
array.forEach(function(item) {
 console.log(item);
});
```

If JavaScript is new to you, or you are curious, it might be helpful to check out the official documentation. 
It has tutorials, examples, and a reference to JavaScript syntax/features. 
There's so much more that we haven't covered on how JavaScript works.

## Setting up JavaScript and Node.js
We will be using `nvm` to install Node.
Nvm makes it easier to jump between versions of node, which you will need for some projects. 

### Node.js

Open up your terminal and run this command. 

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Close and re-open your terminal, and nvm will be installed. 

We will be using version 16.13.2 of node so run these commands. 

```bash
nvm install node
nvm install v16.13.2
```

You can check node is installed with this command. 

```bash
node --version
```

Before we start using Node.js, what is it? 
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that lets us execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
It will also let us use server-side scripting, which makes web development a lot easier.
We will dive a little deeper into this in the upcoming units.
There's a lot more to talk about, and we can't fit it all into this one unit. 
If you want to learn more, you can find many resources online. 

### Running JavaScript

Once node is installed, we can run our own JavaScript code on our computer. 
Create a new file with the `.js` file extension. 
Add this to the file: 

```javascript
//hello.js
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

Go back to your terminal, and we can run these files with a simple command. `node <name_of_file>`
```bash
node hello.js
> Hello, World!
```

## Assignment

This week's assignment is to complete a series of programming problems in javascript code. 
To submit the assignment, create a GitHub repository of your assignment, and submit the URL in the form below.

#### Problem 1
Given an array of numbers, return only numbers divisible by 3
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] -> [3, 6, 9]
```

#### Problem 2
Given a list of names, use  .map to create a list of strings that says "Hi {Name}".
```
["Chase", "Raman"] -> ["Hi Chase", "Hi Raman"]
```

#### Problem 3
Given a list of strings, use .reduce to find the FIRST string in alphabetical order. 
You can use string comparison in JavaScript to compare strings.
```
["JavaScript", "Raman", "Chase", "ICSSC"] -> "Chase"
```

#### Problem 4
Given a list of strings, use a FOR-LOOP to find the LAST string in alphabetical order. 
You can use string comparison in JavaScript to compare strings.
```
["JavaScript", "Raman", "Chase", "ICSSC"] -> "Raman"
```

#### Problem 5
Given a percentage, return the letter grade for that percentage. (Don't worry about +/-).
```
92 -> "A", 75 -> B
```


#### Problem 6
Given a string, return a modified version with the first half in UPPERCASE, and the second half in lowercase. 
If the string has odd length, the middle character can be uppercase or lowercase.
```
"abcdef" -> "ABCdef"
"abcdefg" -> "ABCdefg"
"UNiTeD STATes OF AMerICA" -> "UNITED STATEs of america"
```


#### Optional Stretch Goal: Problem 7
Given an integer y, return a string of a pyramid, with y levels.
