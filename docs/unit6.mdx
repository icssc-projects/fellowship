# Unit 6: Scripting with JavaScript

## Welcome to Unit 6

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language, also considered the programming language of the web. Many web developers use 
JavaScript to create websites and add behavior to them.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level language and is very similar to many languages you might have used before (Python, Java). Here's a quick overview of the basics.

### Printing

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); 
// In Web Development, this will actually show up in the developer console. 
// Open the console in Chrome with cmd+alt+j (mac) or ctrl+shift+j (windows)
```

### Variables

Variables are dynamically-typed, meaning, they don't have a type (like in Python). Undefined variables have the value `undefined`. We use the keywords `var`, `let` and `const` to define variables.

| Keyword | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| var | Defines a variable globally. |
| let | Defines a variable limited in scope to the block. | 
| const | Defines a variable limited in scope to the block, but its value is constant.  |


```javascript
let x = 'hello';
let y = 1234;
let z = false;
var a = 'abc' // Defined globally. 
const pi = '3.14'; //this variable cannot ever be changed.
```

### Loops and Conditionals

JavaScript uses curly brackets `{}`, to denote code blocks for ifs, and loops. 

```javascript
if (i > 5) {
	console.log('i is bigger than 5');
} else if (i >= 3) {
	console.log('i is between 3 and 5');
} else {
	console.log('i is less than 3');
}
for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
	console.log(x);
}
while (true) {
	console.log("repeat");
}
```

We can also use for-each loops in javascript, but only for arrays. 
```javascript
const array = ["one", "two", "three"]
array.forEach(function (item, index) {
  console.log(item, index);
});
```

In fact, JavaScript also has something cool called a for-of loop. This lets us loop through iterables like strings and arrays.
```javascript
const str = "fellowship"
for (const element of str) {
  console.log(element);
}
```


### Strings

```javascript
let clubName = 'icssc';
console.log(className); //icssc
className = className.toUpperCase();
console.log(className); //ICSSC
let part = className.substring(1, 4);
console.log(part); //CSS
console.log(className.indexOf('SSC') >= 0); //whether substring appears
```

### Arrays

Arrays are almost exactly the same as they are in Python.

```javascript
var array = ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3];
console.log( array[2] ); // "c"
console.log( array.length );// 6
//add item to end of the array
array.push('4');

//combine elements into a string
var str = array.join('-');
console.log(str); //=> "a-b-c-1-2-3-4"

//get index of an element (first occurrence)
var oIndex = array.indexOf('x'); //=> 3
```

### Objects

Similar to Python Dictionaries, these are an unordered set of key-value pairs. Unlike python, you don't need quotes around the keys. 

```javascript
ages = {alice:40, bob:35, charles:13}
things = {num:12, dog:'woof', list:[1,2,3]}

//both of these work!
console.log(ages["alice"]); // 40
console.log(ages.bob); // 35
```

### Functions

Define the `sayHello` function that takes in two parameters, `firstName`, and `lastName`.  In JavaScript, parameters are optional. 

```javascript
function sayHello(firstName, lastName) {
	return "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName;
}

console.log(sayHello("Raman", "Gupta")); // Hello, Raman Gupta
console.log(sayHello()); // Hello, undefined undefined

//another way to define a function with =>
let otherSayHello = (firstName, lastName) => {
	return "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName;
};
```

### Callback Functions

Functions are objects, and can be passed as arguments to other function calls. 

```javascript
//Iterate through an array
var array = ['a','b','c'];
var printItem = function(item) {
 console.log(item);
}
array.forEach(printItem);
//more common to use anonymous function
array.forEach(function(item) {
 console.log(item);
});
```

If JavaScript is new to you, or you are curious, it might be helpful to check out the official documentation. It has tutorials, examples, and a reference to JavaScript syntax/features. There's so much more that we haven't covered on how JavaScript works.
